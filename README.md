Once you’ve selected “create”, you’ll be taken to this page. You can select the subscription you would like this Resource group to be added to, create a unique name for your Resource group, and select the region it be located in. Select “Next : Tags” when you finish this step.

Here, you can create tags for your Resource group. Tags allow for better organizational features and consist of a name and corresponding value. Select “Next : Review + create >” to go to the next page.
